# Prework - *ChangingBackgroundColor*

Submitted by: **Sidney Choo**

**ChangingBackgroundColor** is an app that... displays my name, the university I attend, my current status as a student, and then a button. The button changes the background color of the app to a random color each time it is pressed.  

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Instagram
    - can post pictures and videos all in one post
    - people can connect on there thorugh posts, dms, and stories
2. Hevy
    - track all my workouts in a way thats intuitive
    - keeps track of my routines and what weights I lifted last workout
3. Google Calendar
    - can have multiple calendars to categorize
    - color coded events to keep my organized
    
An app idea I have is a Pomodoro timer and to-do list together. The goal with it is to have a fun looking Pomodoro timer to have people stick to it better. The to do list is helpful to have in once place, but also, to better people's (study) habits, to assign tasks to each "focus" period. This way, people have a clear goal on what they want to do during the focus periods. I think also the breaks in each cycle can also give the user a new thing to do to take a break, like suggesting to take a walk or clean the desk or get a snack. It can also connect with the Focus modes on your phone to block certain apps, to really keep you focused. It can be incentivised with in-app fake money to customize the app further or with feeding a chosen animal. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I just struggled to find some of the buttons in XCode, since I think the app has updated since the tutorial was written. I think that once I was able to figure out where the buttons and tools were, it wasn't too hard.
